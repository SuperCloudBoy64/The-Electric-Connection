      <p>Thank you for sending Mr. Assad to my home for this project.  I found him to be friendly, knowledgeable, and forthright.  It is truly a pleasure to work with people who know what they are doing and who take their jobs seriously.  Please list me among the many people who count themselves as references for the work that you and your associates do.
          <br><strong>Chuck M. - Powell, OH 2011</strong></p>

      <p>We’ve used The Electric Connection in the past and always had great luck. This job was no exception. They quoted a start time of 8-12 and were there at 8 sharp. We walked the property and reviewed everything that needed done. They were able to complete most of the job on the first visit, with only minimal wrap-up necessary shortly afterwards. Once everything was done, they did a walk-through with us to make sure everything was as expected. They cleaned up afterwards and were very professional. The final price was exactly as quoted and everything has been working very well in the following 2 months. We were very happy and will use them for any electrical needs in the future!
         <br><strong>Jason K. - Columbus, OH 2013</strong></p>

      <p>I’ve found it’s difficult to find an electrician that will do inside and outside work, and The Electric Connection is the best of both worlds.  They also tend to send me the same people, which is very helpful for several reasons, and it provides continuity to our service.
         <br><strong>Mike C. - Worthington, OH 2014</strong></p>

      <p>I just wanted to write and tell you how pleased I am with the work that was done in my basement yesterday. The two gentlemen that you sent out were prompt, polite, neat and worked hard. The best part was they cleaned up after themselves and made sure I checked it out before they left. I would recommend your company to anyone that asked.
         <br><strong>Gayle S. - Hilliard, OH 2011</strong></p>

      <p>Just wanted to let you know that Dustin, Leonard and team did a very nice job on the installation. Everything was organized, a clean install and very thorough. They went out of their way to make certain that I understood everything that was going on and went through the generator operations. The Columbia Gas tech commented that he had never seen so much get done in one day and he was impressed with the plumber. All in all Jud, a great experience. I appreciate all of your help throughout this process.
         <br><strong>Mike K. - Westerville, OH 2011</strong></p>

         <p>I am writing to commend you on the terrific staff you have. On Friday March 22, your crew of Dustin, Lee, and John, installed a whole house backup generator for us. Before they came out someone had suggested to us that we lay a concrete pad for it. That meant calls to Julie and Chad to verify it’s placement. They were both so polite and helpful. Then came the crew. They were great fun! Don’t get me wrong, they were very professional, but easy to talk to. We had to call the propane company back out to install the proper regulator and they worked hand in hand with him. I never realized what the job entailed either. They were efficient and patient. They did a great job cleaning up too.
         I want the crew to know that their work is appreciated, especially on days they deal with problems. We look forward to doing business with you in the future as needed.
         <br><strong>Bruce & Dottie K. - Peebles, OH 2013</strong></p>
